# boids

This packages simulates a flock of boids of an arbitrary size. The code is based on a 1986 paper by Craig Reynolds, and is adapted from the MPHYG001 lecture notes, written by James Hetherington. These notes can be found at http://github-pages.ucl.ac.uk/rsd-engineeringcourse.

## Installation

The package can be installed using pip from the command line. The required command is:

> pip install git + ...

## Usage

The program may be invoked via the command line as follows:

> boids --size 100

This will result in a simulation of a flock of boids. The 'size' switch determines the number of boids in the flock.
